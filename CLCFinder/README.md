# CLCFinder
CLCFinder is an automated script-based tool for detecting cross-language code.

# Supported Languages and Interface Mechanisms

CLCFinder currently supports three mainstream programming languages: Java, C/C++, and Python, covering the following nine common cross-language interface mechanisms:

- Java–C/C++: JNI, JNA

- Java–Python: Jython

- Python–C/C++: Boost.Python, pybind11, Python/C API, SWIG, ctypes, CFFI

# Usage 

## 1. Download/Clone the CLCFinder Toolkit
Clone this repository to a suitable location and ensure that the runtime path can be accessed correctly. You can integrate CLCFinder into your own analysis workflow as needed

```bash
git clone git@github.com:liyimeng0915/crosslanguage_bug_detection.git
```



## 2. Prepare the Target Code Repository
Prepare a local code repository to be analyzed. The repository should contain source files written in at least two different programming languages, and these languages must include at least two of the following: Java, C/C++, and Python.



## 3. Invoke the Analysis Interface
Invoke the designated function interfaces provided by the MLI module according to your cross-language analysis requirements.
The return value of the function represents the detection results produced by CLCFinder.

```python
import MLI

repo_path = "your_repo_path"

# example : analysis JNI
res = MLI.process_java_c_jni(repo_path)

# res process...

```



## 4. Result Processing
Based on the analysis results generated by the tool, the output data can be further processed as required.
